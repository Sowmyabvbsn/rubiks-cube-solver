## üß† How It Works

### For Everyone (Layman's Explanation)

Think of the Rubik's Cube as a 3D puzzle with 6 faces, each having 9 colored squares. The goal is to arrange all squares so each face shows only one color.

**The Application Process:**
1. **Scramble**: The cube gets mixed up randomly
2. **Analysis**: The computer "looks" at all the colors and their positions
3. **Planning**: Using smart algorithms, it figures out the best sequence of moves
4. **Solving**: It shows you exactly which moves to make, step by step

**Why It's Fast:**
- The computer can analyze millions of possibilities in seconds
- It uses proven mathematical algorithms that guarantee a solution
- It finds the shortest path (usually under 20 moves) instead of trying random moves

### For Developers (Technical Explanation)

The application implements a sophisticated cube-solving system with the following architecture:

#### 1. Cube Representation
```javascript
// Each cubelet has 6 faces with color properties
cubelet = {
  faces: [front, up, right, down, left, back],
  position: {x, y, z},
  orientation: quaternion
}
```

#### 2. State Management
- **Cube State**: Tracked as a 54-character string representing all face colors
- **Move History**: Queue-based system for undo/redo functionality
- **Animation State**: TWEEN-based smooth transitions between moves

#### 3. Solving Algorithm (Two-Phase Algorithm)

**Phase 1: Reduction to G1 Subgroup**
- Orients all edges correctly
- Positions corner pieces in correct orientation
- Reduces 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible states to 19,508,428,800

**Phase 2: Solve within G1**
- Solves the cube using only specific move types
- Guarantees solution within remaining moves

## ‚ö° Performance & Efficiency

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |

## üßÆ Algorithm Deep Dive

### Two-Phase Algorithm Explained

The solver uses Herbert Kociemba's Two-Phase Algorithm, which is mathematically proven to solve any cube in at most 20 moves.

#### Phase 1: Getting to G1 Subgroup
```
Goal: Orient all edges and corners correctly
Moves allowed: All 18 possible moves (F, R, U, B, L, D and their variants)
Search space: ~4.3 √ó 10^19 states ‚Üí ~1.95 √ó 10^10 states
```

#### Phase 2: Solving within G1
```
Goal: Complete the solve using restricted moves
Moves allowed: Only F2, R2, U, U2, U', B2, L2, D, D2, D'
Search space: ~1.95 √ó 10^10 states ‚Üí 1 state (solved)
```

### Why This Algorithm is Optimal

1. **Guaranteed Solution**: Mathematical proof ensures every valid cube can be solved
2. **Optimal Move Count**: Solutions are typically 15-20 moves (optimal is 20)
3. **Fast Computation**: Pre-computed tables make solving nearly instantaneous
4. **Memory Efficient**: Tables are compressed and optimized for web delivery
